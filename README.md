# Rapid Prototyping Mobile Apps
This session is the perfect introduction to rapid prototyping your ideas from day one. You will learn how to use the right tools and skills to go from low to high fidelity designs and validate your ideas without investing much time and money upfront.

#### Rapid prototyping is used through out the entire project to:

- **validate ideas** with end-users;
- collaborate with Product Managers on refining **user stories**;
- communicate **micro-interactions** and patterns to developers;
- get **stakeholders buy-in** and approval;
- and even attract Venture Capital for **your crazy ideas**!

**Rapid Prototyping is the cheapest way** to test any given hypothesis for a Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**) before investing high on developing anything.

By the end of the session, you will have a good understanding of:

1. **Prototyping on day-1 (paper prototyping)** - using the **Pop app** (
   https://popapp.in) with hand sketches to quickly convey or **validate
   your hypothesis**;

2. **Macro Interactions** (low fidelity) - using Keynote or InVision (
   https://www.invisionapp.com) to **test high-level UI patterns** or define requirements;

3. **Micro Interactions** (high fidelity) - using Principle App (http://principleformac.com) to **communicate micro-interactions** with mobile developers or provide that **wow-effect** for funding or buy-in purposes.
